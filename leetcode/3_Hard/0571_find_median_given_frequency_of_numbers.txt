Table: Numbers

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
| frequency   | int  |
+-------------+------+
num is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table shows the frequency of a number in the database.
 

The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample.

Write a solution to report the median of all the numbers in the database after decompressing the Numbers table. 

Round the median to one decimal point.

The result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

Input: 
Numbers table:
+-----+-----------+
| num | frequency |
+-----+-----------+
| 0   | 7         |
| 1   | 1         |
| 2   | 3         |
| 3   | 1         |
+-----+-----------+
Output: 
+--------+
| median |
+--------+
| 0.0    |
+--------+
Explanation: 
If we decompress the Numbers table, we will get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3], so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT ROUND(AVG(num*1.0),2) AS median
FROM (
    SELECT *,
        SUM(frequency) OVER (ORDER BY num ASC) AS accumulated_sum,
        SUM(frequency) OVER () / 2 as medium_num
    FROM Numbers
) AS TEMP
WHERE accumulated_sum - frequency <= medium_num 
        AND accumulated_sum >= medium_num

# The accumulated frequency of the previous num should be smaller or equal to medium_num

Explanation:

1.	Calculate Cumulative Frequency and Median Position:
•	Use SUM(frequency) OVER (ORDER BY num ASC) to calculate the cumulative frequency up to each number.
•	Use SUM(frequency) OVER () / 2 to find the middle position (or positions) in the decompressed list.

2.	Identify the Median:
•	Select the rows where the cumulative frequency encompasses the median position.
	•	WHERE accumulated_sum - frequency < medium_num AND accumulated_sum >= medium_num:
	•	This condition ensures we select the correct number(s) that fall in the middle of the decompressed list.
	•	If the total frequency is odd, this selects the middle number.
	•	If the total frequency is even, this selects the two middle numbers.

3.	Calculate and Round the Median:
•	AVG(num*1.0) calculates the average of the selected middle number(s).
•	ROUND(..., 2) rounds the result to one decimal place.
